## Introduction

Communication has always been key when it comes to becoming a software engineer. They
need it everyday for pointing out certain things like key bugs within code, formating a new app, or even 
simply just asking why does this code do what it does. Within the article "Eric Raymond's How to Ask Questions the
Smart Way", it is discussed how there is a smarter way to ask questions that need answers, without it being considered
lazy or unimportant. Within this essay we will compare what we consider "smart" and "not smart" StackOverflow questions
to show how asking well affects the quality of help recieved. 


## Why Smart Questions Matter 

Being a software engineer doesn't necessarily require you to be an automatic genius, we all have days where we forget simple 
things or tasks. Similarly within code, there are simple mistakes a engineer could make such as forgetting to add a semicolon, 
not adding another bracket, or what type of loops to use when creating a function. These kind of smaller bugs don't 
need a question to be answer as this would just be considered lazy. Software engineer require clear, and precise communication 
within their field of work. Without this, these simple mistakes could become much larger later, creating a crash of the application or
having the whole code display error after error. Smart questions demonstrate respect by showing that the user asking has tried
solving the problem, whether by googling, experiments or even asking peers. Sharing what you have already tried proves there was effort, 
as well as narrows down the problem. Carefully picking the correct forum as well to ask these smart questions, also ensures that the right
audience sees your question and can answer it clearly. Simply having a clear subject line and writing in plain, clean text with good grammar 
denonstrates no distractions and shows professionalism. All together using these principles you will more likely get clear and high quality help 
to any question. Understanding these principles is very helpful, but seeing them applied to real scenarioes make their value even clearer. StackOverflow provides much of these examples of what are considered smart and not smart questions.

## Example of a Smart Question

Searching through the website StackOverflow, which is known for it being a question and answer website specifically for programmers and developers, 
I have come across both bad and great questions to be asked. An example of one of these smart questions was "How to fix 'Initializer proves no value 
for this binding element and the binding element has no default value' in Typescript". This question was an excellent example of how to ask a smart question
on StackOverflow, as it follows all the principles Eric Raymond had laid out. For examplem, its subject line was clear and specific, it displays the exact error message 
as well as the code used, and lastly it listed what the user had already tried. Here is the link to the [Smart Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57527710/how-to-fix-initializer-provides-no-value-for-this-binding-element-and-the-bindi).
This question is even highly upvoted, meaning it was a very valid and great question overall, The community responded to this question with very detail and useful answers quickly, and even gave their own link to a typescript playground where they have 
the functioning code. The community came together proving that smart questions with the principles discussed allow for the best responses. 


## Example of a Not Smart Question 

While the smart question had every principle from Raymond's article, I also found a question that demonstrates the opposite. One of these came in the form of C sharp question, asking "C# '+=' Operator". Notice that this is not a clear subject line, and 
instead gives a vague, less informative question. As I continue to search for the real issue within this question, it is finally stated at the end of the post stating "What function does this operator perform?". Notably this post was 11 years old, yet during this time
the internet still provited simple answers for asking these type of not smart questions. Within the post there is some code provided, but with how simple and lazy this question is it shows no prior effort to even solve the issue independently. This question could have simply been posted rather, 
on google where it would've gave a clear and concise response to what the "+=" operator does in CSharp. This is the link to the [Not Smart Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25824057/c-sharp-operator). This post was given two answers, one displaying how the user who posted this post needs to learn the basics
before posting on StackOverflow, and the other gave a generous response simply telling the new developer what the "+=" operator does, as google would've provided as well. Overall this question lacks any of the principles, and ends up being a reflection of the user's laziness or lack of clarity.


## Conclusion

Smart questions are not just for getting answers, they build on what others have worked towards and encourages collaboration, as well as credibility. The principles that are built when it comes to asking smart question gives tools that the user can use in other walks of life, whether it be in the softwarae 
engineering field or not. It is a professional skill to ask smart questions as it reflects respect for others time, commitment to problem solving, and a willingness to learn as well. The comparison between the two StackOverflow questions demonstrates how dramatically responses can change depending on whether or not 
Raymond's principles are applied. The smarter questions were given thoughtful and detailed solutions, while the not smart questions created frustration, and led to very shallow and unhelpful replies. Beyond my work in this class, I see Raymond's guidelines not just as advice for StackOverflow, but as a framework for 
how I should ask questions anywhere. Whether it be in the classroom, internships, or in a professional career, I should always strive to ask that smart question. By doing so I will not only improve my own learning, but contribute to a culture of communcation and collaboration in the wider software engineering community.
