summary: "Collaborated with two other Computer Science majors to program an NAO robot to perform human-like actions such
as walking and facial recognition. Troubleshooted and refined the robot's code during weekly meetings.
Presented our research at the S.U.R.F. research fair at KCC."

The NAO Robot Project was the idea of using the coding language Python, and programming the NAO Robot to do human movements and facial recognition.
Through much trials and errors, as well as researching how the NAOqi framework works, we eventually allowed the robot to recognize faces, and respond
with a hello and a goodbye. We also coded up the NAO robot to even take go up one step, as with its proportions being small, we used a math textbook.
While this achievement may seem small, the movement of its legs took many weeks, tweaking and adjustings its joints to perfection.
