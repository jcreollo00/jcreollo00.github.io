summary: "Collaborated with two other Computer Science majors to program an NAO robot to perform human-like actions such
as walking and facial recognition. Troubleshooted and refined the robot's code during weekly meetings.
Presented our research at the S.U.R.F. research fair at KCC."

The NAO robot project was ta semester club for Kapiolani Community College that provided students with a chance to work with robots, and boost there knowledge of the coding language Python. The idea of working with NAO robots fascinated me as I never worked within robotics before, however I have definetely worked on Python. Joining the event, I was alonside two other computer science major students, Koa and Justin. With our mentor Lisa Miller, a ICS professor at KCC, she lead the way in how to begin and how eevrything works. She showed us how the NAOqi framework needed editing, how Python is used to design and coordinate how the joints move, and how the presentation for the KCC Surf fair would work. 

Through trial and error, me and Justin using Python successfully coded up the NAO robot to greet and dismiss people with facial recognition. While it wasn't perfect, and we had an error where it would repeatedly say "Hello!", we still did a great job configuring human-like emotions within the robot. Our other Computer Science major Koa, coded up a way for the legs to go up a step. Using simply a math textbook, she successfully moved the robots joints to go into an upward motion. Together at the KCC surf fair, we successfully presented our work and demonstrated to hundreds of students how Python changed the NAO robots abilities.
