summary: "During covid-19, I needed a major upgrade for my gaming rig as I was still on the Xbox One. As the new generations of consoles
were rolling out, I decided to instead invest in something that will last me much longer, a brand new gaming rig built from the ground up. Without
any hardware knowledge at all, I built my PC through pure will."

PC building has essentially brought me to where I am today. Without it, it would not have inspired me to pursue a career in software development, 
as my thinking for CS stem'd from this build. Without any knowledge about PC's at all, I researched day and night to find the correct parts for 
the entire thing. Whether it was the motherboard, GPU, CPU, ram, whatever the case I made sure that each piece fit perfectly with the other. Overall
this experience shed a new light on the process of building such a highly sophisticated device. Allowing me to learn new skills such as hardware engineering,
software configuration, troubleshooting, and cable management.
