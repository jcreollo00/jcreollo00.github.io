summary: "During covid-19, I needed a major upgrade for my gaming rig as I was still on the Xbox One. As the new generations of consoles
were rolling out, I decided to instead invest in something that will last me much longer, a brand new gaming rig built from the ground up. Without
any hardware knowledge at all, I built my PC through pure will."

When the whole world went into isolation, everyone was inside. Whether they were finding new hobbies, rotting away in bed, or playing video games 24/7, we were all at home. During this time, I had no school, and no plans, so I played video games all day everyday. On my old gen Xbox One, I would be inches away from the screen playing all sorts of games, from Call of Duty, to Assassins Creed, to even horror games like outlast. During this time as well I was constantly watching youtube, which made me realize how much of a downgrade my console was compared to the PC's these big name streamers had. This gave me the idea, what if I could build my own?

As a sophomore in high school, I worked at a fast food company surrounded by greasy food. But with nothing else on my mind, it gave me a mindset to push forward and finance enough to upgrade my PC. As soon as my money was set, I researched day in and day out to figure out what parts went with the others. From the motherboard, to the CPU, to the cooling, I had to ensure everything was perfect for one another. After I ordered all the parts, I then watched tons of youtube tutorials showing how to instal the Windows UI, how to attach the RAM correctly, and etc. Finally, after all the parts arrived, I used my hardware knowledge and built my PC. After a couple dreadful hours of plugging in many cords and figuring out what goes where, I booted it up and it worked perfectly. Overall, this PC project of mine taught me valuable lessons about how to focus and really learn new skills in a field I am not accustomed to.
