The Pokemon GUI was a project designed for a previous ICS class, that allowed for users to go through a menu
in which they can choose from a variety of Pokemon. These Pokemon were then added to their team, creating a custom Pokedex, from the video
games themselves. This project's key features included GUI frameworks, GUI implementation, and user selection logic.
